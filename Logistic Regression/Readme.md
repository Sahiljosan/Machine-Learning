### What is Logistic Regresssion ?
-  Logistic Regression is applied to predict the categorical dependent variable.
-  In other words, it's used when the prediction is categorical like (yes or no), (True or False), (0 or 1)
-  The predicted probability or output of logistic regression can be either one of them, and there's no middle ground

### Advantages of Logisitic Regression
-  It is very simple and easy to implement.
-  The output is more informative than other classification algorithms
-  It expresses the relationship between independent and dependent variables
-  Very effective with linearly seperable data

### Disadvantages of Logisitic Regression
-  Not effective with data which are not linearly seperable
-  Not as powerful as other classification models
-  Multiclass classifications are much easier to do with other algorithms than logisitic regression
-  It can only predict categorical outcomes
