# Naive Bayes Classifier
- It is supervised learning algorithm used for classification based on Bayes' Theorem 
- NBC is not just an algorithm, but a collection of many algorithms that work on the same concept, the Bayes' Theorem <br><br>

## Industrial Use of Naive Bayes Classifier
1. News Categorization
2. Spam filtering 
3. Object and face recognition.
4. Medical Diagnosis 
5. Weather Prediction etc..

## Type of Naive Bayes Classifier <br>
We have three type of naive bayes classifier 
1. Gaussian 
2. Multinomial 
3. Bernoulli

## Bayes' Theorem
NBS works only on the bass theorem. Let's see what the bass theorem is.
                    P(H/E) =  P(E/H) P(H)/P(E)
                    
  - H- Hypothesis  , E-Event / Evidence 
  - Bayes' Theorem works on conditional probability
  - We have been given that if the event has happened or the event is true, then we have to calculate the probability of Hypothesis on this eve
  - Means the chances of happening H when the event E is happened.

`P(H):` It is said `priori (A prior probability)`, Probability of H before E is happen.<br>
`P(H/E):` `Posterior probability`, Probability of E  after event E is true.
