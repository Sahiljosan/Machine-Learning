## Problem Statement 
- Predict the chances of admission based on the given attributes

## Task we have performed:
1. Data ingestion
2. EDA
3. Graphical Analysis (DATA Visualization)
4. check correlation between features
5. Perform Train Test Split
6. SVR Model Training
7. Check Performance Metrics
      - mean_sqaured_error
      - mean_absolute_error
8. R Sqaure
9. Adjusted R Square
10. Hypter-Parameter Tuning
11. Again check performance metrics after hyper-parameter tunning
      - mean_sqaured_error
      - mean_absolute_error
      - R Sqaure
      - Adjusted R Square
