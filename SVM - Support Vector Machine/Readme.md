In this repository we have done practical implementation of 
## SVM on Wine quality data 
- This is a classification problem so we have used SVC (support vector classifier)
 (sunny has taken this class on 29.10.2022)
 
## SVM kernels (class taken by krish naik on 30.10.2022)
- This is a classification problem so we have used SVC (support vector classifier)
