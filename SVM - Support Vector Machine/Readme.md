# SVM Pracitcal implementation 
In this repository we have done practical implementation of 
## SVM on Wine quality data [Class taken by Sunny on 29.10.2022]
- This is a classification problem so we have used SVC (support vector classifier)

 
## SVM kernels [class taken by krish naik on 30.10.2022]
- This is a classification problem so we have used SVC (support vector classifier)

## Practical Implementation of ROC AUC Curve [Krish Naik 30.10.2022]
- `AUC:` Area under Curve
- `ROC:` An Roc curve (Receiver Operating Characteristics) is a graph showing the performance of a classification model at all classification thresholds
